### Fireblanket main config
# Octothorpes are comments and can only be found at the start of a line.

## Privileged users
# Specifies users that are allowed to perform potentially extremely destructive commands. Treat with EXTREME CAUTION.
# Reccomended to match users given the "netadmin" role.
privileged-users: jaskarth,unascribed;

## Mixin SCRAM
# Force disables mixins from being loaded. Treat with EXTREME CAUTION, as certain mixins are required for functionality.
# The format is a regex, so it is possible to disable an entire package.
# Example:
# mixin-scram: ai.MixinTemptGoal,client.hooks.*;
mixin-scram: ;

## Forced load radius
# Chunk accesses and loading can become very expensive for a large fest. This option keeps a predefined region of chunks
# loaded (but not ticking), so that cold accesses don't suffer a fetch from disk. WARNING: This option can dramatically
# increase the memory usage of the server, so treat with care! A value of '0' disables this optimization.
# Value is defined in blocks.
forced-load-radius: 0;

## Flatten chunk palettes
# Flatten chunk data to use an array instead of looking up a palette each time. This allows significantly faster lookups
# at the cost of tremendous memory usage.
flatten-chunk-palettes: no;

## Allow Footguns
# Disable pre-emptive disabling of @e selectors unless 'force=true' is also specified.
allow-footguns: no;

## Avoid zstd
# Disables the usage of zstd to save world data and compress network connections.
avoid-zstd: true;

## Gameplay Changes
# Allow altering features in a way that impacts gameplay.
gameplay-changes: no;
