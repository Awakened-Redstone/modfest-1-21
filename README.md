**ModFest 1.21** was a mod development jam that ran from October 11th through November 4th, 2024.

This modpack contains all submissions, as well as a showcase world built by participants to show off their mods!

**Key Features**:
- Witness the dawn of 59 mods, including **Armistice**, **Charta**, **FBombs**, and **Life-Size Bdubs**!
- Explore a circular world split into four "ages" - Stone, Iron, Industrial, and information!
- Traverse the map with prehistoric angry birds, fancy bombs, ninja outfits, and a *lot* of watches!
- Whistle along to over *one hour* of original music made just for the event! 
- Find and earn XXX collectible "shards", tracking booth visits, exploration, and mastery!
- Decide once and for all - was the town of Stasis really eaten by a world-swallowing dragon? or is that just what the locals believe?
